Notes for myself.

  Running sample script to build sample installers.
    FORMIC_HOME="/home/ervandew/files/development/java/formic/build/formic/" \
    ANT_HOME="/home/ervandew/files/development/java/formic/build/formic/ant" \
      ant/bin/ant -lib samples -buildfile samples/build.xml

  When upgrading ant be sure to modify ant.bat to return an error code on
  failure.
