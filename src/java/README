Third Party Open Source Code in Formic CVS

  The majority of the third party open source code residing in the formic cvs
  tree is there to help reduce the size of the jars attached to the resulting
  installers by only including the classes required by formic and eliminating
  all others.

  - java.util.concurrent backport: 3.1

  - apache commons
    - collections: 3.2
    - io: 1.2
    - lang: 2.1

  - apache ant: 1.6.5
    - To facilitate proper feedback of the progress of certain ant tasks during
      an install, several parts of the code have been patched to facilitate the
      required monitoring.

  - charva: 1.1.2
    - Implementing necessary gabs between charva and swing that are needed to
      build robust console based interfaces.  I plan to contribute these
      upstream periodically and hopefully remove the code out of the formic cvs
      tree if they are accepted.
      List of modified src files:
        - Component
          - Property change support.
        - JComponent
          - Client property support.
        - JTextField, JTextArea, JTextComponent, JPasswordField
          - Added Document support.
        - JCheckBox, JRadioButton
          - Added ButtonModel support.

  - swingfx waitwithstyle
    - The included classes make up a modified version (by Andy DePue) of the
      infinite progress code found in swingfx.  Since there is no online
      repository established for this code, no signs of Andy's modification
      making it into the swingfx tree, and the fact that I made a couple minor
      modifications to allow it to adapt to the look and feel of the
      application, the code has been committed to the formic cvs tree.
