Open Source Code in Formic CVS
The majority of the third party open source code residing in the formic cvs
tree is there to help reduce the size of jars attached to the resulting
installers by only including the classes required by formic and eliminating all
others..
  - java.util.concurrent backport: 2.2
  - apache commons
    - collections: 3.2
    - io: 1.2
    - lang: 2.1
  - apache ant:
    - To facilitate proper feedback of the progress of certain ant tasks during
      an install, several parts of the code have been patched to facilitate the
      required monitoring.
  - swingfx waitwithstyle
    - there is no online repository established for this code, and I made a
      couple minor modifications to allow it to adapt to the look and feel of
      the application.
