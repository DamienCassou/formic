      <p>
        Formic is an installation framework built on top of
        <a href="ext:ant">apache's ant</a>.  The idea is to leverage the vast
        amount of functionality that ant provides (directly and indirectly
        through third party add-ons) to create a framework based on a paradigm
        that the entire ant user base is familiar and comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formic consists of a set of ant tasks for packaging and running
        graphical and console based installers.  The entire process of
        creating an installer with formic can be summed up in the following
        three steps.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a series of panels (or utilize the formic supplied panels) for
          the installation wizard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an ant script to be executed by the installer for install and
          un-install of your application, which describes the flow of the
          installation wizard plus the series of ant tasks necessary to
          (un)install your application on the host system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Package your application files, installation build file, and a
          stripped down version of ant into platform specific executables.
        </li>
      </ol>

          Sourceforge project is now all setup.  I'm hoping to have an initial
