  Enhancements

        1) Read location of "file" appender.
        2) Load current contents into a JTextArea
        3) Register an appender for appending content to the JTextArea
           - appender = new AsyncAppender();
             appender.addAppender(new WriterAppend(layout, new
             JTextAreaWriter(textArea)));
        - downside is possibility of lost or redundent logging info if a lot of
          messages are being logged when the above steps are executing.
    - Add support for automated installs.

      progress window + installer window)?
      - how can installer notify splash screen that it has started.

  Uninstaller
    - uninstall wizard panels
      Abstract InstallStep to provided shared functionality.
    - create exe/sh at installer build time and have install procedure populate
      an ini or property file that the uninstaller can use for info it needs
      (install location, product name, service info, etc).
    - result should be a directory 'uninstall' with an exe/sh and

NOTES {{{

  Notes for myself.

    Running formic packager:
      build/formic/bin/formic -buildfile build/formic/samples/build.xml

    When upgrading ant be sure to modify ant.bat to return an error code on
    failure.
